The project, HOLIDAY HOME is a web-based application that allows the hotel manager to handle all hotel
activities online. Interactive GUI and the ability to manage various hotel bookings and rooms make this system very
flexible and convenient. The system allows the manager to post available rooms in the system. Customers can view
and book room online. Admin has the power of either approving or disapproving the customers booking request.
The system is hence useful for both customers and managers to portable manage the hotel activities.
